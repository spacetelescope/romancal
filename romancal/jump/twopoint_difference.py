"""
Two-Point Difference method for finding outliers in a 4-D ramp data array.
The scheme used in this variation of the method uses numpy array methods
to compute first-differences and find the max outlier in each pixel while
still working in the full 4-D data array. This makes detection of the first
outlier very fast. We then iterate pixel-by-pixel over only those pixels
that are already known to contain an outlier, to look for any additional
outliers and set the appropriate DQ mask for all outliers in the pixel.
This is MUCH faster than doing all the work on a pixel-by-pixel basis.

    Find CRs/Jumps in each integration within the input data array.
    The input data array is assumed to be in units of electrons, i.e. already
    multiplied by the gain. We also assume that the read noise is in units of
    electrons.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data: input 4-D flat array (num_integrations, num_groups, num_rows, num_cols)
        input ramp data

    groupdq : ndarray
        input 4-D group DQ flags

    read_noise : 2D float32
        The read noise of each pixel

    rej_threshold : float
        cosmic ray sigma rejection threshold

    nframes : int
        The number of frames that are included in the group average

    flag_4_neighbors): boolean
        if set to True (default is True), it will cause the four perpendicular
        neighbors of all detected jumps to also be flagged as a jump.

    max_jump_to_flag_neighbors : float
        value in units of sigma that sets the upper limit for flagging of
        neighbors. Any jump above this cutoff will not have its neighbors flagged.

    min_jump_to_flag_neighbors : float
        value in units of sigma that sets the lower limit for flagging of
        neighbors (marginal detections). Any primary jump below this value will
        not have its neighbors flagged.
