About models
============

The purpose of the data model is to abstract away the peculiarities of
the underlying file format.  The same data model may be used for data
created from scratch in memory, or loaded from ASDF files or some future file
format.


Hierarchy of models
-------------------

There are different data model classes for different kinds of data.

One model instance, many arrays
-------------------------------

Each model instance generally has many arrays that are associated with
it.  For example, the `ImageModel` class has the following arrays
associated with it:

    - `data`: The science data
    - `dq`: The data quality array
    - `err`: The error array

The shape of these arrays must be broadcast-compatible.  If you try to
assign an array to one of these members that is not
broadcast-compatible with the data array, an exception is raised.

Working with models
===================

Creating a data model from scratch
----------------------------------

To create a new `ImageModel`, just call its constructor.  To create a
new model where all of the arrays will have default values, simply
provide a shape as the first argument::

    from romancal.datamodels import ImageModel
    with ImageModel((1024, 1024)) as im:
        ...

In this form, the memory for the arrays will not be allocated until
the arrays are accessed.  This is useful if, for example, you don’t
need a data quality array -- the memory for such an array will not be
consumed::

  # Print out the data array.  It is allocated here on first access
  # and defaults to being filled with zeros.
  print(im.data)

If you already have data in a numpy array, you can also create a model
using that array by passing it in as a data keyword argument::

    data = np.empty((50, 50))
    dq = np.empty((50, 50))
    with ImageModel(data=data, dq=dq) as im:
        ...

Creating a data model from a file
---------------------------------

The `romancal.datamodels.open` function is a convenient way to create a
model from a file on disk.  It may be passed any of the following:

    - a path to an ASDF file
    - a readable file-like object

The file will be opened, and based on the nature of the data in the
file, the correct data model class will be returned.  For example, if
the file contains 2-dimensional data, an `ImageModel` instance will be
returned.  You will generally want to instantiate a model using a
`with` statement so that the file will be closed automatically when
exiting the `with` block.

::

    from romancal import datamodels
    with datamodels.open("myimage.asdf") as im:
        assert isinstance(im, datamodels.ImageModel)

If you know the type of data stored in the file, or you want to ensure
that what is being loaded is of a particular type, use the constructor
of the desired concrete class.  For example, if you want to ensure
that the file being opened contains 2-dimensional image data::

    from romancal.datamodels import ImageModel
    with ImageModel("myimage.asdf") as im:
        # raises exception if myimage.asdf is not an image file
        pass

This will raise an exception if the file contains data of the wrong
shape.

Saving a data model to a file
-----------------------------

Simply call the `save` method on the model instance.  The format to
save into will either be deduced from the filename (if provided) or
the `format` keyword argument::

    im.save("myimage.asdf")

.. note::

   This `save` always clobbers the output file.


Copying a model
---------------

To create a new model based on another model, simply use its `copy`
method.  This will perform a deep-copy: that is, no changes to the
original model will propagate to the new model::

    new_model = old_model.copy()

It is also possible to copy all of the known metadata from one
model into a new one using the update method::

    new_model.update(old_model)

History information
-------------------

Models contain a list of history records, accessed through the
`history` attribute.  This is just an ordered list of strings --
nothing more sophisticated.

To get to the history::

    entries = model.history
    for entry in entries:
      pass

To add an entry to the history, first create the entry by calling
`util.create_history_entry` and appending the entry to the model
history::

    entry =  util.create_history_entry("Processed through the frobulator step")
    model.history.append(entry)

These history entries are stored in ``HISTORY`` attributes when saving
to ASDF format. As an option, history entries can contain a dictionary
with a description of the software used. The dictionary must have the
following keys:

  ``name``: The name of the software
  ``author``: The author or institution that produced the software
  ``homepage``: A URI to the homepage of the software
  ``version``: The version of the software

The calling sequence to create a history entry with the software
description is::

  entry =  util.create_history_entry(description, software=software_dict)

where the second argument is the dictionary with the attributes mentioned.

Looking at the contents of a model
----------------------------------

Use ``model.info()`` to look at the contents of a data model. It renders
the underlying ASDF tree starting at the root or a specified ``node``.
The number of displayed rows is controlled by the ``max_row`` argument::

  im.info()
  root.tree (AsdfObject)
  ├─asdf_library (Software)
  │ ├─author (str): Space Telescope Science Institute
  │ ├─homepage (str): http://github.com/spacetelescope/asdf
  │ ├─name (str): asdf
  │ └─version (str): 2.5.2a1.dev12+g12aa460
  ├─history (dict)
  │ └─extensions (list) ...
  ├─data (ndarray): shape=(2048, 2048), dtype=float32
  ├─dq (ndarray): shape=(2048, 2048), dtype=uint32
  ├─err (ndarray): shape=(2048, 2048), dtype=float32
  ├─meta (dict)

  └─var_rnoise (ndarray): shape=(2048, 2048), dtype=float32 ...

  Some nodes not shown.


Searching a model
-----------------

``model.search()`` can be used to search the ASDF tree by ``key`` or
``value``::

  im.search(key='filter')

  root.tree (AsdfObject)
  └─meta (dict)
  ├─instrument (dict)
  │ └─filter (str): F170LP
  └─ref_file (dict)
    └─filteroffset (dict)
