Likelihood Fitting
==================

There is a new algorithm available ramp fitting, which is the likelihood
algorithm. This algorithm is now the default algorithm for Roman. It also can be
explicitly selected by setting ``--ramp_fitting.algorithm=likely``. The details
are in the ``stcal`` documentation at :ref:`Likelihood Algorithm Details
<stcal:likelihood_algo>`.
