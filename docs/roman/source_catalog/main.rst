Description
===========

:Class: `romancal.source_catalog.SourceCatalogStep`
:Alias: source_catalog

This step creates a catalog of source photometry and morphologies.
Both aperture and isophotal (segment-based) photometry are calculated.
Source morphologies are based on 2D image moments within the source
segment.


Source Detection
----------------
Sources are detected using `image segmentation
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_segmentation>`_, which is a
process of assigning a label to every pixel in an image such that
pixels with the same label are part of the same source.  The
segmentation procedure used is from `Photutils source extraction
<https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segmentation.html>`_.
Detected sources must have a minimum number of connected pixels that
are each greater than a specified threshold value in an image.  The
threshold level is usually defined at some multiple of the background
standard deviation above the background.  The image can also be
filtered before thresholding to smooth the noise and maximize the
detectability of objects with a shape similar to the filter kernel.

Source Deblending
-----------------
Overlapping sources are detected as single sources.  Separating those
sources requires a deblending procedure, such as a multi-thresholding
technique used by `SExtractor
<https://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor>`_.  Here we use the
`Photutils deblender
<https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/segmentation.html#source-deblending>`_,
which is an algorithm that deblends sources using a combination of
multi-thresholding and `watershed segmentation
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watershed_(image_processing)>`_.  In
order to deblend sources, they must be separated enough such that
there is a saddle between them.

Source Photometry and Properties
--------------------------------
After detecting sources using image segmentation, we can measure their
photometry, centroids, and morphological properties.  The aperture
photometry is measured in three apertures, based on the input
encircled energy values.  The total aperture-corrected flux and
magnitudes are also calculated, based on the largest aperture.

The isophotal photometry is based on `photutils segmentation
<https://photutils.readthedocs.org/en/latest/segmentation.html>`_.
The properties that are currently calculated for each source include
source centroids (both in pixel and sky coordinates), isophotal fluxes
(and errors), isophotal area,
semimajor and semiminor axis lengths, orientation of the major axis,
and sky coordinates at corners of the minimal bounding box enclosing
the source.

Photometric errors are calculated from the resampled total-error
array contained in the ``ERR`` (``model.err``) array. Note that this
total-error array includes source Poisson noise.

PSF Fitting
-----------

Star finding algorithms like `~photutils.detection.DAOStarFinder` provide
approximate stellar centroids. More precise centroids may be inferred by
fitting model PSFs to the observations. Setting the SourceCatalogStep's
option `fit_psf` to True will generate model Roman PSFs with
`WebbPSF <https://webbpsf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/roman.html>`_, and fit
those models to each of the sources detected by
`~photutils.detection.DAOStarFinder`. More details are in :doc:`psf`.

Note that pixel coordinates are 0 indexed, matching the Python 0-based
indexing. That means pixel coordinate ``0`` is the center of the first
pixel.


Segmentation Map
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The segmentation map computed during the source finding process is saved
to a single 2D image extension in a FITS file. Each image pixel contains an
integer value corresponding to a source label number in the source catalog
product. Pixels that don't belong to any source have a value of zero.


Multiband Catalogs
------------------
Multiband catalogs use a combination of images to construct a deep
detection image which is used to detect sources and find segments.
The measured positions and shapes of the sources in these deep images
are then used for aperture and Kron photometry in each filter.
Catalog fields are broadly similar to those in the source catalog
schema above.  However, they have the following differences:

* Fields derived from the individual filter images are prefixed with
  the name of the filter from which they were derived.  For example,
  there will be a series of fields like ``<filter>_flux_psf`` giving
  the PSF flux in each filter.
* Fields derived from the detection image and segmentation map have no
  filter prefix.

Multiband catalogs are produced by the ``MultibandCatalogStep`` and
take an association file as an argument, listing the different images
which need to be photometered simultaneously.


Forced Source Catalogs
----------------------

Source catalogs may optionally be produced by taking the segmentation
image from one image (the "forcing" image) and asking to compute shapes and fluxes on those
same segments in another image (the "forced" image).  The two images must be perfectly
aligned for this to make sense.  In this mode, the source catalog
contains a number of fields with the ``forced`` prefix in addition to
those described above.  Fields without the "forced" prefix indicate
shape and location information derived from forcing image and give the
locations where information was measured on the forced image.  Fields
with the ``forced`` prefix indicate values computed on the forced image,
using the information from the forcing image.  For example, the field
``forced_kron_flux`` is the Kron flux measured on the "forced" image
using the centroid and shape information given in the ``xcentroid``,
``ycentroid``, ``semimajor_sigma``, ``semiminor_sigma``, and ``orientation``
fields.

Forced source catalogs may be produced by specifying a segmentation
image with the --forced_segmentation argument when running the source
catalog step.
